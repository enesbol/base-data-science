Directory to store raw and processed data used in the project.

# Document the data

Good data documentation can answer such questions:

### Overview
- What types of data are stored in this directory?
- Why was this data selected for the project?
- How was the data obtained and processed?
- How frequently is the data refreshed or updated?
- What are the key characteristics of the data (e.g., mean, median, mode, skewness)?
- What transformations or cleaning techniques were applied to the data?
- Are there any known issues or limitations with the data?
- How does the data comply with user agreements, data privacy regulations, and security measures?
- Document column definitions while building a model to save time and increase data quality.

 
Data documentation ensures ethical and responsible data usage, aids in issue troubleshooting during modeling, and facilitates future data reuse. A data dictionary encourages data standards and reuse.


### Future Steps:

- Use dbt to define table, model, and column descriptions alongside the code for smooth workflow.
- Utilize data catalog tools like Castor to auto-populate definitions across datasets, saving time and effort for analytics engineers and data analysts.
